              The basic arithmetic operations for real numbers are addition,
              subtraction, multiplication, and division.
            </p>
            <p>
              The basic arithmetic properties are the commutative, associative,
              and distributive properties.

            Division is the inverse of multiplication. Rather than multiplying
            quantities together to result in a larger value, you are splitting a
            quantity into a smaller value, called the quotient. Again, to return
            to the box example, splitting up a group of 8 boxes into 4 equal
            groups results in 4 groups of 2 boxes:
          </p>
          <p>See the following example below:</p>
          <div class="code">
            <code>6 boxes divided / into 3 locations = 2 boxes</code>
          </div>

        <section class="main-section" id="ADDITION">

            <h1>Addition</h1>
          </header>
          <p>
            Addition is the most basic operation of arithmetic. In its simplest
            form, addition combines two quantities into a single quantity, or
            sum. For example, say you have a group of 2 boxes and another group
            of 3 boxes. If you combine both groups together, you now have one
            group of 5 boxes. To represent this idea in mathematical terms:
          </p>
          <p>See the following example below:</p>
          <div class="code">
            <code>1 box + 1 box = 2 boxes</code>
          </div>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="SUBTRACTION">
          <header>
            <h1>Subtraction</h1>
          </header>
          <p>
            Subtraction is the opposite of addition. Instead of adding
            quantities together, we are removing one quantity from another to
            find the difference between the two. Continuing the previous
            example, say you start with a group of 5 boxes. If you then remove 3
            boxes from that group, you are left with 2 boxes. In mathematical
            terms:
          </p>
          <p>See the following example below:</p>
          <div class="code">
            <code>1 box - 1 box = 0 boxes</code>
          </div>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="MULTIPLICATION">

            <h1>Multiplication</h1>
          </header>
          <p>
            Multiplication also combines multiple quantities into a single
            quantity, called the product. In fact, multiplication can be thought
            of as a consolidation of many additions. Specifically, the product
            of x and y is the result of x added together y times. For example,
            one way of counting four groups of two boxes is to add the groups
            together:
          </p>
          <p>See the following example below:</p>
          <div class="code">
            <code>2 boxes + 2 boxes + 2 boxes = 6 boxes</code><br/>
            <code>2 boxes * 3 locations = 6 boxes total
